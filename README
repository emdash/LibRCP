Overview

 LibRCP is a C++ library for decoding the telemetry stream sent by the
 RaceCapturePro data logger. It is written with embedded systems in
 mind, and has constant space requirements. While the telemetry format
 used by RaceCapturePro is JSON-based, LibRCP can only handle the
 RaceCapturePro telemetry format in use at the time of this writing
 (June, 2014). It is not a full JSON parser.

Usage

 There is no installation proceedure. Simply include the library in
 your project. A sample Makefile is provided which builds two targets:
 rcpparse and gui. Both read from stdin. A sample data stream captured
 from a race capture pro device is provided.

Examples

 First, build the source (you will need gtk+2.0-dev installed to build
 the gui example):

  $ make

 Decode sample datastream file to stdout:

  $ ./rcpparse < datastream

 Display live telemetry data from a serial interface on
 /dev/ttyS0. This assumes the serial port is configured to the correct
 baud rate.
 
  $ ./gui < /dev/ttyS0

 Display data from telemetry generator:

  $ python rcpsender.py | ./gui
